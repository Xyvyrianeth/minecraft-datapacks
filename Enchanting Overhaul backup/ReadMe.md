## Enchanting Station
I wanted to simply use a smithing table to apply enchantments like how you upgrade to netherite, but apparently crafting recipes don't allow NBT manipulation and I can't apply enchantments with it, so I settled for a fake smithing table that you just have to look at.

To create this fake station, simply put a glow item frame on top of a real smithing table and put an amethyst shard on it. To use it, put the item you want to enchant in your mainhand and the gem you want to enchant with in your offhand, then look at the station and crouch.

To remove this station, simply destroy the block below it. Trying to place it in the air will not work because it'll just break immediately.
